# From Beer to IPA


## Synopsis

Two examples projects of the native iOS app that we created realtime at the Mobile App Development meetup in Amsterdam on the 30th of November 2016 at the Searchlite headquarters.


## Installation

As we said in the presentation we need to install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/xcode/id497799835?l=en&mt=12) and [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org).
Just install Xcode from the Mac AppStore.

Open up your Terminal and install Cocoapods using the following command:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Browse to the folder Step 1 or Step 2 project and run this command:

```
pod install
```

Open up the .xcworkspace and you're ready to go!


## API Reference

To fetch beers we're using the BreweryDB API in this example. More info on [BreweryDB.com]("https://www.brewerydb.com/developers")
